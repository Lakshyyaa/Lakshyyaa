  <p>
    I love building and breaking apps that provide value to people. Whether it's a small feature or a full-scale system, the process of ideating, developing, and iterating is something I truly enjoy. I believe in creating software that makes a real difference.
  </p>

  <p>
    Software and all things web are my domain. I'm constantly pushing myself to learn more, stay curious, and explore new ideas. Building for scale and experimenting with cutting-edge technologies is part of what keeps me going.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm skilled in the MERN stack and T3 technologies, but I'm always open to trying new things. If you're looking for someone to collaborate with, I'm here to help bring your ideas to life.
